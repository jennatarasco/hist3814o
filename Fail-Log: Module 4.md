This week I really enjoyed the readings and the exercises. I loved seeing all the different ways we could incorporate visuals into our final exercise. The two exercises that I chose were Topic Modeling in R and Text Analysis with Overview. 

I had some difficulties in the top modleing exercise when it came to trying to incorporate the different graphs (cities, years, etc.) I was able to resolve the issue by clearning the text and re-entering the ulr. I have been fidning it difficult to navigate through my issues when there is too mcub text or codes on the screen. By clearing the screen I was able to start fresh and locate where my mistakes were. 

Text analysis with overview was really simple to nagivate and simple to serach through the different words and text in the document. I found the word cloud really easy to help find words to serach throughout the document and it enabled me to visualize the imporatance of concepts better than others. 

My DH Box is expiring in 3 days (June 7) so I am trying to get the majority of my work completed by then. In the upcoming days I plan on finsihing and finalizing my capstone exercise and incoporate the different visualization tools learned in this module. I am excited for what I can make of my blog with all the different tools I have learned over the weeks!
