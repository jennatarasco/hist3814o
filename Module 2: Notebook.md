## Module 2: Notebook ##

Exercise 1: The Dream Case 
•	Had to review the steps on how to create a work today’s file since I was unable to locate the original file. It was a good refresher to go over and got he steps again. 
•	No results came up for my surname 

Exercise 2: Wget
•	Easy to follow instructions – do you follow step 2 to create new files all the time and then just rename them? – if so would I need to make a file named ‘Markdown’?

•	When I entered the command “wget -m -w 2 --limit-rate=20k http://activehistory.ca” I was getting an error message but then when I went to go check the file all the pages were there.

•	I forgot to save my history for downloading all the pages from the first part of the 
exercise 

Exercise 3: TEI
•	Once completing the encoding I saved my work but when I opened in in my browser it looked exactly like the encoding aspects of the black text editor. I then followed the steps on what to do when there is no color coding and I was still left with my original result. 
•	I went back and redid the whole exercise, I was mistyping the code.

Exercise 4: 
•	I found this exercise the most challenging, it took me several tries to try to create the json file and get a hang of it
•	I was not able to complete fully and an still working on it!

Exercise 5: Completed – took some time 

Exercise 6:
•	Getting an error message after trying to install ImageMagick.
•	I will continue to play around with it to complete the exercise. 

### Building A Volunteer Community: Results and Findings from Transcribe ###
•	The material in the reading really helped me gain a better sense of understanding of how a community helps promote resources and technological software. A community such as a school can help promote, test, and apply necessary steps needed for a technological program to get stronger and more efficient. 

•	For this class we use several different software’s that allow us to form our own technological community since it is an online course. Our community helps individuals gain the confidence needed to succeed in using these programs and eventually enables us to use them outside of the course. 

•	Although these software’s have been tested, updated, and redesigned, every time someone uses them they are gathering feedback through our actions, work, and speed when completing assignments, interacting with others, or even filling out those surveys that are sent out when using apps. 

•	For example, if I didn’t take this course I would have never used annotations. This is a program I will end us using even when the course is over. I can use this program for my other classes which could help me keep track of my readings online. The community on the annotation site enables me to ask, answer, and relate to those either in the same class or just in general.
