## Exercise 1 ##
I have no problems creating new files, however every time I go to check is the file was created "ls" all my previous created files also appear. Is this soemthing that is supposed to happen or am I supposed to get rid of them somehow? 
I was also having a difficult time when I went to input the command "nano texas.txt" I went to go look up my file that was created with the list of names that we were copy but I was getting a "file not found" message. I back tracked my commands and noticed that I did not created the file "texas.txt.bak" I was then able to create that file and the list of the names appeared.
After that I had a pretty smooth time during the remainder of the exercise, this gave me hope that I am maybe on the right track of this course and am finally getting the hang of things.

## Exercise 2 ##
Open Refine has actually been my favourite part of this course so far. I loved that everything ended up in an organized manner after the copy and pasting of the names in the first exercise. When I first created my project I noticed that some of the names were messed up (commas where there shouldnt have been), I went back to the regex portion of the exercise and realized that we needed to correct the 13 mistakes. 
After doing that and saving, and uploadng the new document, when I created another new project everything was fine and looked alike. The merging and reclustering were quick and easy. 

## Capstone Exercise ##
This exercise was really helpful in the sense that it allowed me to get a better grasp on the open refine software. I had to back track the steps of the other exercises in order to help complete this one. I also found that it is easier for me to keep a paper notebook of all the commands and steps in the other exercises that allowed me to keep better track of what i've accomplished. This has helped me not waste time by looking back in other modules and looking through all the exercises.
