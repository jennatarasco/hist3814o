## Exercise 4: Text Analysis with Overview ##
I enjoyed the Overview software, it was efficent, organized, and simple to use. Word clouds are something that particular catch my eye no matter where they are used, so when I uploaded the document and was presented with one I was sold. The word cloud also made it easy to serach for words, they give you plently of ideas and what ti serach and enable you to see why they chose bigger fonts and bolder colours for certain words and smaller and lighter fonts for others. 
On the blog there was several different posts that I found intresting but Five things you didnâ€™t know Overview could do was the one I enjoyed. It was so cool to see the different aspects of information you could find using this software, this would be a perfect tool to use on the assigment due to the layout, informative structure, and simplicity. Another aspect of the softaware I would like to use on my assignment is customizing the word cloud. On the blog they have an example of a customized cloud and I think it would add character and dimension to my blog for the assignment. 

## Exercise 3: Topic Modeling in R ##
RStudio in the DH Box was another exercise I enjoyed. This would allow me to analyze some of the documents going into my blog to help make it more visually pleasing. I have also loved reading blogs where graphs and plots are used - it makes it easy to follow, looks more ogranized, and allows for different dimensions of the information to be relayed. I plan on using this tool for my assignment also. Between the word cloud and the graphs I believe that my blog for the assigment can help tell the story and history in a visual way making it easy to understand and a great way to become aware of the past. 

## Readings ##
The scholars in the weekings for this week really enabled me to make better connections to data trends, visualization aspects, and reserach evidence. For reserach projects that I have done in the past I found it hard to try to prove my point with little evidence in the form that I wanted it in. I can now understand just because evidence is presented in alternative forms it is still acceptable to use and it can even provide my reserach paper or project with greater dimension and texture. This is something that I will carry forward with me for my upcoming projects. 

I also really enjoyed the blog Sonic Word Clouds: an Experiment with Data Sonification (Introduction). Seeing how this indiviual visually presented information the project allowed me to gain a better understanding of what layout would look best based on the type of visual I plan on using. It also touched on the limitations of some of the visual tools which I thought was an important concept seeing as a blog is a place where readers want to feel comfotable in where the information is and how to navigate through the different posts. 

## Capstone Project ##
From the beginning of the course I was so certain I was going to create my own project on the war dairy, Over the past week I have deiced to work on expanding one of the other pieces of work, this has allowed me to get a better understadning of how the project should flow and what tools would best work. Although I had wasted so much time converting all 80 pictures into text and then cleaning that text up, it allowed me to pratice other modules that were done at the beginning of the course. with expadning on another piece of work I feel that my project has a better chance of being done better then if I was trying to create it from stratch.
