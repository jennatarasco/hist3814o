## Exercise 4: Text Analysis with Overview ##
I enjoyed the Overview software, it was efficent, organized, and simple to use. Word clouds are something that particular catch my eye no matter where they are used, so when I uploaded the document and was presented with one I was sold. The word cloud also made it easy to serach for words, they give you plently of ideas and what ti serach and enable you to see why they chose bigger fonts and bolder colours for certain words and smaller and lighter fonts for others. 
On the blog there was several different posts that I found intresting but Five things you didnâ€™t know Overview could do was the one I enjoyed. It was so cool to see the different aspects of information you could find using this software, this would be a perfect tool to use on the assigment due to the layout, informative structure, and simplicity. Another aspect of the softaware I would like to use on my assignment is customizing the word cloud. On the blog they have an example of a customized cloud and I think it would add character and dimension to my blog for the assignment. 

## Exercise 3: Topic Modeling in R ##
RStudio in the DH Box was another exercise I enjoyed. This would allow me to analyze some of the documents going into my blog to help make it more visually pleasing. I have also loved reading blogs where graphs and plots are used - it makes it easy to follow, looks more ogranized, and allows for different dimensions of the information to be relayed. I plan on using this tool for my assignment also. Between the word cloud and the graphs I believe that my blog for the assigment can help tell the story and history in a visual way making it easy to understand and a great way to become aware of the past.
